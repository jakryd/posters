Abstract. 
Recent developments in enhanced sampling methods showed that it is possible 
to find ligand unbinding pathways with spatial and temporal resolution 
inaccessible to experiments. Such techniques should provide an atomistic 
definition of possibly many reaction pathways, otherwise it may lead either 
to overestimating energy barriers, or inability to sample hidden energy 
barriers that are not captured by simple reaction pathway estimates. 
We provide an official Plumed 2 module that implements a method which is able
to sample the reaction pathways of the ligand-protein dissociation process. 
The method is based on enhanced sampling and non-convex optimization methods.
The module, called MAZE, requires only a crystallographic structure to start a 
simulation, and does not depend on many ad hoc parameters.  To present its 
applicability and flexibility, we provide several examples of ligand unbinding 
pathways along transient protein tunnels reconstructed in a model 
ligand-protein system.
